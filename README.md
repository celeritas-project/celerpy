# celerpy

You can pronounce this package like "slurpee," or really any other way you
want. This `celerpy` package will be the Python-based front end to the
[Celeritas](https://github.com/celeritas-project/celeritas) and include a
user-friendly execution interface, visualization components, and postprocessing
utilities.


# Development

Development is a little weird if you're not used to modern python projects,
especially because [python development and packaging evolves so
quickly](https://dev.to/farcellier/i-migrate-to-poetry-in-2023-am-i-right--115).
To isolate the development environment, `pyenv` and `pip`
install a toolchain locally.

## Setting up

External dependencies (easily installed through [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) or
another package manager):
- [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv), which will install its own python versions in an isolated environment

After cloning the repository:
```console

```
